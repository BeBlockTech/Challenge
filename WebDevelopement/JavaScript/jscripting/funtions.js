/*We can refactor this function in three ways. 

1-The most condensed form of the function is known as concise body.
Functions that take a single parameter should not use parentheses. 
The code will still work, but it's better practice to omit the parentheses around single parameters. 
However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.

2-A function composed of a sole single-line block is automatically returned. 
The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow => and the return keyword can be removed. 
This is referred to as implicit return.

3-A function composed of a sole single-line block does not need brackets.
